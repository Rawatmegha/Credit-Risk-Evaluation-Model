Credit Risk Prediction Project 

This project is about helping banks decide if someone can repay a loan or not. Normally, this takes a lot of time and can be unfair, so we used machine learning to make the process faster and smarter.

We got loan data from the internet (Kaggle), cleaned it up, and used charts to understand it better. Then, we tried different models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees. The best one was Random Forest, which gave the most accurate results.

We found that a person’s credit history, income, and loan amount are the most important things in deciding if they are a good borrower. We also solved common problems like missing data and imbalance in the dataset.

The final system lets bank staff enter someone’s information and get an instant risk result — high or low. This helps banks approve loans faster and avoid giving loans to people who might not pay them back.

In short:
We built a tool using machine learning that makes loan approval quicker, smarter, and fairer for everyone and help to find the eligible person for the credit card.
